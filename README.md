## Objective

The **ThermoSphere** project aims to:
- Automate calculations of steam properties such as pressure, temperature, enthalpy, entropy, specific volume, and internal energy using two independent input parameters.
- Identify and classify the thermodynamic state of steam, including:
  - Compressed liquid
  - Saturated liquid
  - Saturated vapor
  - Superheated steam
  - Mixed (liquid-vapor) state
- Enhance the understanding of thermodynamic principles and their real-world applications.

## Features

- **Property Calculation**:
  Input two thermodynamic properties to calculate the remaining ones.
  
- **State Identification**:
  Automatically classify the steam state based on input values.
  
- **Flexible Input Options**:
  Supports multiple units (e.g., MPa, bar, kPa for pressure; Â°C, K for temperature).
  
- **User-Friendly GUI**:
  - Enter inputs via text fields.
  - View results dynamically in an organized format.
  - Visual cues and color coding to indicate steam states.

- **Extensive Documentation**:
  Includes a user manual, code documentation, and example test cases.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: JavaFX
- **Libraries**:
  - JavaFX for GUI components
  - Apache Commons Math (optional for advanced calculations)
  
- **Data Source**: Reference steam tables from reliable textbooks which exist in the resources file.
